# fluentbit-operator

FluentBit operator for Kubernetes based on Fluent-bit.

## What is this operator for?

This operator helps you to pack together logging information with your applications. With the help of Custom Resource Definition you can describe the behaviour of your application within its charts. The operator does the rest.


## Project status: Alpha

This is the first version of this operator to showcase our plans of handling logs on Kubernetes. This version includes only basic configuration that will expand quickly. Stay tuned.


## Installing the operator

```
helm repo add kubesphere https://github.com/kubesphere/fluentbit-operator/tree/master/deploy/helm
helm install kubesphere/fluentbit-operator
```

## Example

The following steps set up an example configuration for sending nginx logs to ElasticSearch.

### Create FluentBit resource

Create a manifest that defines that you want to parse the kubernetes logs on the standard output of pods, and store them in the given ElasticSearch.
